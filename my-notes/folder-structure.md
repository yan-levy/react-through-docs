# Project Folder Structure

The following is a typical folder structure for a web development project:

- **pages**: Contains Next.js pages that correspond to specific routes in your application.
- **components**: Houses reusable UI components. Each component may have its own folder with a `.js` file for the component logic and a `.module.css` file for component-specific styles.
- **styles**: Contains global CSS styles that are applied across your application.
- **public**: Stores static files such as images, which can be accessed directly from the public URL.
- **utils**: Holds utility functions or helper files used throughout the application.
- **services**: Contains files for interacting with external services or APIs.
- **hooks**: Stores custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic.
- **constants**: Holds constant values or configuration files.
- **context**: Contains files related to React Context API for managing application-wide state.
- **layouts**: Stores layout components that wrap multiple pages or sections with common layouts.
- **tests**: Contains test files for testing your components or utilities.
- `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc`: Configuration files for ESLint and Prettier, used for code linting and formatting.
- `package.json`: The package file that defines project dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: The project's README file with documentation and instructions.

Feel free to customize this structure based on your project's needs and preferences.
